# AI Snake

This is an experiment with using AI/ML in a practical use case. Eventually using Deep Q Learning to play a simple game of snake.

# Instructions

Install the necessary python requirements (requirements.txt) and use one of the following command lines

## Play the game

There is a console version of the game which uses wasd controls that can be launched using

`python game_curses.py`

There is a GUI version of the game which uses direction keys

`python game_ui.py`

## Traditional Q-Learning
Launch an agent to do training using traditional Q-Learning. This will run 100k training episodes to fill in the Q table and then launch the gui to play a few games using the trained q-table so you can visualize how well the system learns.

`python simple_agent.py'
